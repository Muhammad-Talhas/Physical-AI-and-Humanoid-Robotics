## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose and history of ROS 2.
- Identify key concepts and architectural components of ROS 2.
- Set up a basic ROS 2 development environment.

## Overview

This chapter provides an introduction to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software. We will explore its core concepts, architectural differences from ROS 1, and guide you through setting up your first ROS 2 workspace.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is an open-source middleware suite for robot applications. It is designed to be a flexible framework for writing robot software, providing a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviors across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

### Key Features of ROS 2

*   **Distributed Architecture**: ROS 2 supports a distributed system where multiple processes and machines can communicate seamlessly.
*   **Real-time Capabilities**: Enhanced support for real-time control, crucial for many robotic applications.
*   **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Configurable QoS policies for reliable communication, including durability, reliability, and latency.
*   **Security**: Built-in security features using DDS-Security, allowing for authentication, encryption, and access control.
*   **Multi-robot Support**: Designed with multi-robot systems in mind, simplifying coordination and communication between multiple robots.

## History and Evolution from ROS 1

ROS 1, released in 2007, quickly became the de facto standard for robotics research and development. However, it had limitations, particularly concerning real-time performance, security, and multi-robot support. ROS 2 was developed to address these limitations, building on a redesigned core using Data Distribution Service (DDS) as its communication middleware.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes

Nodes are executable processes that perform computations. In ROS 2, a robot system is typically composed of many nodes, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., a camera driver node, a motor control node, a localization node).

### Topics

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. A node can publish messages to a topic or subscribe to messages from a topic. This publish/subscribe model allows for decoupled communication between nodes.

### Services

Services enable nodes to send a request and receive a response. This is a synchronous communication mechanism, useful for operations that require an immediate result.

### Actions

Actions are similar to services but are designed for long-running tasks. They provide feedback during execution and allow for preemption (canceling a goal). Actions are typically used for tasks like navigating to a goal or performing a complex manipulation.

## Setting up your ROS 2 Environment

This section will guide you through installing ROS 2 on your system and setting up your development workspace. (Detailed installation steps will be provided here for common operating systems like Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS, focusing on a specific ROS 2 distribution, e.g., Iron or Humble).

### Installation Steps (Placeholder)

1.  **Choose your ROS 2 Distribution**: Select a stable distribution (e.g., Iron Irwini, Humble Hawksbill).
2.  **Install ROS 2**: Follow the official installation guide for your operating system.
3.  **Source the Setup Files**: Configure your shell environment to use ROS 2.

## Summary

In this chapter, we introduced ROS 2, its core features, and its evolution from ROS 1. We discussed fundamental concepts like nodes, topics, services, and actions, and outlined the steps to set up a ROS 2 development environment. The next chapters will delve deeper into each of these concepts with practical examples.

## Exercises

1.  **Research**: Explore the official ROS 2 documentation and identify at least three advantages of ROS 2 over ROS 1 not explicitly mentioned in this chapter.
2.  **Installation**: Follow the official ROS 2 installation guide for your operating system and verify your installation by running a simple `talker-listener` demo.
3.  **Concept Mapping**: For a robotic system (e.g., a mobile robot with a camera), identify potential ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions that would be involved.
