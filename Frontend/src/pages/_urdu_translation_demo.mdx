# Urdu Translation Demo

This page demonstrates the integration of Urdu translation features within the textbook environment.

## Features

- Placeholder for Urdu language toggle.
- Example of translated content (currently in English for demonstration).
- Integration with a translation service or pre-generated static content.

## Implementation Notes

- This page serves as a placeholder for the Urdu translation demo.
- The actual implementation would involve either runtime translation (e.g., via an LLM API) or pre-generated static Urdu pages.
- Considerations for RTL (right-to-left) text layout and font support would be important here.
